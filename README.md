# CapstonePortfolio

This project was submitted as my Final Capstone Portfolio Project at Colorado State University. 
I was tasked with creating a business intelligence solution for an international organization of my choice.
Included in the other documents are screenshots of Tableau analyses that were completed with data stored in Microsoft SQL Server.
Also included are the business intelligence solution writeup and business intelligence solution presentation to be presented to stakeholders of the organization.
